# Day 5: What the Funk!?

- my first attempt at a funk piece
- my first attempt to use the BOSS RC-202 Looper
- keyboard input via Roland FP-7F digital piano
- drums input via AKAI Professional MPK Mini Play
- take 1 - honest! :) and you do hear it ... :(
- 90 bpm

## The good

- my first real use of the looper I bought last year
- it was a lot of fun to play and felt good
- great sound on the headphones

## The bad

- it did not feel good at all listening to it afterwards (terrible timing ...)
- bad mixing

# Miscellaneous

## Preparations before jamming

### Funk beat

It's a beat from the song ["Give Up the Funk" by Parliament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Give_Up_the_Funk_(Tear_the_Roof_off_the_Sucker))

I got it from [10 MUST KNOW Easy Funk Drum Beats | Stephen Taylor Drum Lesson](https://youtu.be/8FfQLaAvI-s?t=315)

Ghost notes are in lower case

| Snare |   |   | X |    |   |   | X | _a | _e |   | X |    |   |   | X |   |
| Kick  | X |   |   | _A | X |   |   |    | X  |   |   | _A | X |   |   |   |

## Piano groove

I took cues from Kent Hewitt's [Funk Exercise (Modal Groove)- C Minor Pentatonic Scale](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kAto95SuTU)

- two chords: C7#9 / F13
- C minor pentatonic scale for improv: C Eb F G Bb
