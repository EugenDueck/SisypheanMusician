# Day 7: No fun today

- tired from a long day, I thought I'd just do a quick blues using the looper's builtin swing rhythm, play in a walking bass line and then improvise over it
- half an hour (and two dozens - mostly early-aborted - takes) later, I still wasn't happy with anything and decided to do just a solo piano blues and call it quits
- so this is take 28
- still not happy, but need sleep
- this is the first time I recorded the sound of the Roland piano directly, but I should have turned down the volume... and the mp3 encoding somehow messed up the sound completely - anyway, that's it for today
