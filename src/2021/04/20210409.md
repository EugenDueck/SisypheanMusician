# Day 8: O du langsamer Augustin

- original arrangement of "O Du lieber Augustin" from 2020, played very slowly
- take 12 (less than half of yesterday)
- recording an acoustic piano using the ZOOM Qn4's mic
- wouldn't have thought I could get a somewhat acceptable version done today - happy it worked out!
