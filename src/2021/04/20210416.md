# Day 15: Marital Duty - No 1

- my wife had the brilliant idea to write a couple of notes for me to turn into music
- I was dithering between latin and ballad, and went for the latter
- I interpreted the (originally very simple) rather rhythm freely, and added a couple of notes
- the form is this tune ABA, with each part consisting of 8 bars; the A parts have set chords and melody, for part B I only fixed the chords
- the good thing about ballads: they are not very demanding in terms of pianistic technique; still it took so many dozens and dozens of takes to get at the final version... (is that why they are called "takes" - because they take so long? ;-)
