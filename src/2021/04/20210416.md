# Day 15: Marital Duty - No 1

- my wife had the brilliant idea to write a couple of notes for me to turn into music
- I was dithering between latin and ballad, and went for the latter
- the form is ABA, with each part consisting of 8 bars; the A parts have set chords and melody, for part B I only fixed the chords
- the good thing about ballads: they are not very demanding in terms of pianistic technique
