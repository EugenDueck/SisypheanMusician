# Day 16: Lillie #2 [Acoustic vs. Digital Piano vs. FluidSynth/MuseScore]

- I wrote this ballad on 2001/12/20
- the "Digital Piano" and the "FluidSynth" parts are rendered from the same MIDI data, so it's perfect for comparing the Roland FP-7F's sound (recorded via Analog Out to Zoom Q4n) and that of FLuidSynth using "MuseScore_General_Full" sound font
- after a phazillion of (mostly early aborted) takes on my digital piano, I went for the one in this clip, and after that did the acoustig piano recording in a single take
- this was the hardest of the "Everydays" for me to play so far - the block chord passages are tricky
