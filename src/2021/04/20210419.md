# Day 18: Fakebook Chords - No 1: 12th Street Rag

- my first ragtime ever! (because the first tune of that fakebook happens to be a rag)
- got up to speed with the chord changes in less than an hour
- getting an acceptable version recorded is quite another matter and took 2 more hours - not happy, but it is what it is
