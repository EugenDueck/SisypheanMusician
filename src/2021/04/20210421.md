# Day 20: What the Blues!?

- basic swing rhythm from https://viva.pressbooks.pub/openmusictheory/chapter/swing-rhythms/
- the rhythm loop transition is not smooth
- I don't play the tenor sax very idiomatically
- my new pedal for the looper still needs more getting used to
- gotta get out of bed early tomorrow morning, so: it is what it is
- I find it actually not too bad for a second take
