# Day 22: Blues in any key but F - No 4: D again

- this is the continuation of Day 19, where I played a blues in D I had written earlier
- this time I wanted to improvise over it
- still more tired than yesterday - I wanted to do just one form
- what started as improvisation evolved - through the dozens of takes - more and more into something like a composition, at least the first couple measures
