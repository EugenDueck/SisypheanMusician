# Day 27: Learning Something New: Diminished Scale (C)

- getting up to speed with the diminished scale today, still mostly theoretically
- alternating whole-half steps
- can be used on diminished chords
  -  the one starting from C works over C dim / Eb dim / Gb dim / A dim
- the variant starting with half-whole can be used on dominant chords
  - the one starting from D works over D7 / F7 / Ab7 / B7
  - half-whole is almost identical to the altered (aka super-Locrian) scale
- today's recording is just playing the scale up and down two octaves and a bit of jamming with it over dominant chords
  - I played a Bb once - which is not part of the scale, i.e. a mistake
