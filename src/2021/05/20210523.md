# Day 52: Poor Butterfly in Stride Piano

- the arrangement was again finished quickly, but even after many hours of trying to play it, I couldn't get it done today
  - so this is partly stride piano, with a couple of mistakes, and then moving to a more simple accompaniment, to get this somewhat acceptable version out
  - the day still has 8 more hours, but I'm too frustrated to go on
  - not sure whether the problem is
    - slow memorizing skills (the arrangement was not written down, I just used the lead sheet for orientation)
    - lack of concentration
    - will become doable with more practice
