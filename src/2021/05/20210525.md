# Day 54: Poor Butterfly (Medium Swing) with iReal Pro

- I played the sax (right hand) and piano (left hand) parts on my digital piano, iReal Pro took care of bass and drums
- the tenor sax sound of my Roland digital piano is not that great, especially with long held notes
- I don't know where this crackling sound is coming from - it can be quite annoying at times
- since the bass was very low, I used the "sox bass" effect (with a gain of 15) in kdelinve to make it louder
