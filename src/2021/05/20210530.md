# Day 59: Quickie: Blues in F with iRealPro

- I shamelessly stole the first melody tones and the tempo (124 bpm) from this super groovy rhythm section: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jO4-cn2TpMQ
- the ending does not fit, but I don't know if iRealPro can do better endings - and this is a quickie, so no time for research today
- I made the iRealPro track louder than last time, maybe that sounds better on ultra portable laptops and smartphones
  - Sox Bass Gain of iRealPro 15
