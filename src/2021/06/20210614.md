# Day 74: Walking Bass + Improv

- realizing that my original goal yesterday (freely improvising over the fixed walking bass line) was not attainable despite lots of practicing, I figured I should simplify the task for today by simplifying the bass line, realizing that:
  - it's better to master something simple (that you can build on) than to botch something more sophisticated (that you cannot build on)
- so I removed all eighth notes, leaving only quarter notes
- when playing, the left hand automatically adds some "dirt" in the form of (swing eighths) to make it more interesting, but the advantage compared to playing the eighths as written: I don't need to divert my (scarce) conscious attention from improvising to in the right hand, to following the letter of the score in the left
- that said, the left hand still needs some conscious thought every now and then. especially in parts that start the same but then branch off differently (e.g. Bb7 to F7 vs Bb7 to B07)
- so I will just practice this more (there is still room for simplifying, but at the expense of interestingness of the bass line, so I probably won't simplify any further)
