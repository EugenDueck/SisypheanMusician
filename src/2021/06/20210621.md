# Day 81: "Moon River" changes with iReal Pro

- Jazz-Ballad Swing / 80bpm (I can't handle 60 bpm yet - too slow)
- I have a feeling my left hand staccato comping is not very balladesque ("Blue in Green" from 6/18 is the style I should perhaps have adopted here as well)
- the original melody is nice, but it's not in the public domain, so I won't play it here
