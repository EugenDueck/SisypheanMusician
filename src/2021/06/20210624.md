# Day 84: Blues Etude

- an etude created this evening, and this is the best I can do today in terms of playing it; I will redo this in a couple of days
- the goal is to chase the right hand up and down the keyboard
- arpeggios: major triad, dominant seventh with the ninth
- scales: minor, altered, whole-half, chromatic, Blues
- mostly eighth triplets, some sixteenth, and even a few thirty-seconds at the end
