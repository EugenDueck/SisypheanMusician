# Day 94: J.S.Bach Invention 1 (first 6 bars)

- Bill Evans is supposed to have said that Bach('s Inventions, Sinfonias and The Well-Tempered Clavier) were instrumental in developing his technique, and playing them (rather than practicing), is all he needs
- so I'll try the same - it will be welcome training of my very poor sight-reading skills as well
- there is actually a mistake in bar 5, where I play a C# in the left hand instead of a C, that I didn't realize until it was pointed out to me
