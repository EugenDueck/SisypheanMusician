# Day 100: J.S.Bach Invention 1

- not perfect, but finally - after six days with a total of perhaps close to ten hours of practice of this piece alone! - a take that is more or less "correct"
- the tempo is way too slow, but I need more practice to ramp it up
- take 8 this morning
- practising something like this is boring as hell - my blood pressure probably drops close to fainting; and maybe that's the reason it takes forever for my finger to memorize this (although I'm still looking at the sheets, the notes are long memorized, but it's not in the finger memory yet, so I make mistakes almost every time I play it)
