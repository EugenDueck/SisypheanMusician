# Day 101: "War'n Spa√ü" - almost there!

- today I finalized the score for this piece that I wrote the other day
- I then practiced this many hours, but I can't yet play it without mistakes
- so the B section has a couple of mistakes, and the ending was improvised, as I didn't manage to play the written one in this take
- and in general it's too fast for me, but this piece (particlarly the B section) doesn't sound at a slower tempo
