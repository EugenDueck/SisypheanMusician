# Day 103: 5/4 Vamp

- today I tried a 5/4 rhythm
- the first 8 bars are a (once repeated) arpeggio of 4 bars that I wrote
- the rest is my attempt to improvise over a vamp on the 4 chords
- 5/4 is hard, it does not feel natural at all
- so I am playing only quarter notes, with no pause, to not lose the beat
- still a couple of times I ended up with a 6/4 bar
  - 6/4 feels much more natural, 5/4 feels like stopping one beat short of a 6/4 bar
- for the improvised ending I didn't even bother trying 5/4
