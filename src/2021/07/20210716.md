# Day 106: 5/4 Blues in F

- with iReal Pro as backing track (not recorded) at 100 bpm
- the plan was to do a 3-chorus take, playing the root and chord in the left hand on every beat 1, as proof that I'm always aware of the 5/4 groove
- after 2 hours, I gave up not managing to do that, because I lost the 5/4 groove a couple of times during every take
- so I am resigning myself to this last take, which isn't very good, but reflective of the current state
- I still hope these hours were not in vain, but a step in the direction of actually feeling the 5/4 groove, and I'll give it another try in the next couple of days
