# Day 107: 5/4 Blues in F

- same as yesterday
- I'm a little bit more confident in 5/4 now, but I still occasionally add or remove one beat, meaning I don't fully "feel" 5/4, like I feel 4/4, 3/4, 6/8, etc.
- I need to do more of this and hopefully I'll be able to do 5/4 without concentrating or counting
