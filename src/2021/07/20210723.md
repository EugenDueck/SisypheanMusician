# Day 113: First bars of "Erinnern an 'Erinnerungen an Bartfeld'" by Adalbert Keler

- a nice and fun piece by Adalbert Paul Keler: "Erinnerungen an Bartfeld"
- not to be confused with Brahms' rip-off by the name of "Ungarischer Tanz Nr. 5", where he replaced Keler's bridge by his own one, which I find much less beautiful
- these are the first couple of bars - to be continued
