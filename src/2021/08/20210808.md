# Day 129: Bartfeld 32ndths sixths slow practice

- today with new fingering (3/1 4/1 5/2 ...) after consulting a pianist
- playing with metronome at â™©=70, with the ticks on "and"
- at this slow tempo, the sixths are sometimes satisfactory, at higher tempos they still sound rushed
- with the new fingering, it should be possible to get up to higher tempos, given practice
