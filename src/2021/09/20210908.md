# Day 160: "Bruce" practice

- that's right, I said "practice", not "music"
- even so, this is take 20 or so, as I'm frequently making mistakes, hence the need for practice
- the goal of this drill is twofold:
  - independence of left hand rhythmic pattern and right hand improv
  - practicing the blues scale in the key of G
