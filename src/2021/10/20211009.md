# Day 191: Bartfeld

- long time no play
- but I may have found a way to practice the sixths runs to speed:
  - play with a metronome at a very comfortable speed (like 160)
  - increase the bpm only so far as you can with completely relaxed hand
  - the next day the maximum speed with relaxed hands may be significantly higher (185)
- let's see if this recipe works reliably
