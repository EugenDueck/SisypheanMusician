# Day 244: Off the grid piano setup

- there a couple of mistakes and the dynamics are hard to get right
- sometimes, 61 keys are just not enough
- this tiny piano does need some getting used to, although not as much as I would have feared

The following items are enough if all one wants to do is playing off the grid:
- Korg microPIANO, on NiMH batteries
- Korg DS-1H damper pedal

For this recording, I used these additional items, so I did not need to record through a mike, but more or less directly with an audio cable:
- a BOSS RC-202 looper
- Anker PowerCore III Elite 26000mAh 87W
- a USB-C to 9V trigger
- a 9V polarity inverter cable
- AKG 240 MK II head phones

Note to self: If I use the looper only to make two audio outputs from one, a y cable would be a much more lightweight choice - will need to order me one!
