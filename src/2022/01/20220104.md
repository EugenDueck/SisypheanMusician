# Day 278: "Simple Blues Bassline"

- added fingering to a bassline I created before, so I can automate it in order to be able to focus on right hand improvisation
- I made small changes to the earlier bassline, still I don't like measures 5 and 6 - if someone can come up with a better idea, please let me hear it...
- as the recording shows in measure 7, I often fall back into walking bass mode, which defeats the purpose of this exercise, so I need to practice this for a bit
