# Day 311: Neues Wanderlied

- hiking has always been popular in Germany, and has recently been seeing something of a revival
- this is a new song about that activity - I have written the chorus and 2 verses today, I just need to practice this, and perhaps add another verse, and then sing and play the whole piece
